The program from last week wasn't posting for me so I was unable to test my saving in this application. I was able to test saving  to localstorage using a different program but not this one. I added comments to where I included new code so that it's able to read. I created an update message and a save message function, then added a condition to the send message that if name is empty in local storage, to send an alert that they have to send a message. I was unable to test functionality,but the logic of the code seems to properly work
### How long it took me to finish this?
